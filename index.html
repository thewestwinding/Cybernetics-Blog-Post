      This piece by David Bowen takes live data from a NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association)
      buoy near Alaska and represents this through the physical grid you see in the video.

    <p style="font-size:120%">
      I took a particular interest in this piece for many reasons. The one relating most to this class is a
      video I saw months ago where local news used a 3D animation to explain the effects of flooding in
      cities and just how tall water could get compared to houses, cars, trees, and a human being. I've 
      embedded this video below. I'm not sure in what ways this technology could be used to mimic the use of augmented reality
      in the below video, but I think it is an interesting intersection of education, broadcasting, cybernetics, and new media.

      <h2>2. wing</h2>

      "Wing", the name of the above piece, was commissioned for GLOBALE: Exo-Evolution exhibition 2015 (by the description of the above 
      video on Vimeo.) Participants attach wires to sensors, and then attach those sensors at certain points around their ear. The movement
      of certain ear muscles will spur movement in a large machine that looks like a bird's wing. 
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:120%">
      As stated in the video description, "The main idea...is...ironical and at the same time serious research on the topic of 
      development of new instruments and prostheses as "extensions" of human body...At the same time, it's an attempt to stimulate people 
      to perceive and train the body in a different way, expanding the limits of self-control and self-organisation...At the same time, 
      ...this project uses the metaphor of flying as a reward for the ability to direct your mind to solving of 
      non-standard tasks."
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:120%">
      I really appreciate this exposure to extensions of the human body, especially because of the personal connection one can make with
      the art given that you would be directly causing its movements. As someone who appreciates when art makes you feel something beyond
      an intellectual level, I think this piece is fantastic in terms of connecting in multiple ways to participants (i.e., physically,
      spiritually, emotionally, etc.)
